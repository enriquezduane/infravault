# ADR-010: Monitoring and Logging (Standard Linux Tools)

## Context
InfraVault Phase 1 requires comprehensive monitoring and logging capabilities to:
- Track application health and performance
- Monitor system resources and capacity
- Detect and diagnose issues quickly
- Maintain security and audit trails
- Support troubleshooting and debugging
- Provide visibility into user behavior and system usage
- Establish baseline metrics for future optimization

The monitoring solution must be practical for a single-server deployment, cost-effective, and provide a foundation for the advanced observability stack planned for Phase 4.

## Decision
We will implement monitoring and logging using **standard Linux tools** and **Docker logging capabilities**, combined with **structured application logging**.

### Monitoring and Logging Architecture:
- **System Monitoring**: Standard Linux tools (htop, iostat, df, free, netstat)
- **Container Monitoring**: Docker stats and Docker Compose logs
- **Application Logging**: Structured JSON logging with log rotation
- **Log Aggregation**: Centralized logging with Docker log drivers
- **Health Monitoring**: Custom health check endpoints and scripts
- **Performance Monitoring**: Basic performance metrics collection
