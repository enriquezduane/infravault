# ADR-008: Security Implementation (HTTPS, Let's Encrypt)

## Context
InfraVault Phase 1 requires comprehensive security measures to protect:
- User authentication data and sessions
- Uploaded image files and metadata
- API communications between frontend and backend
- Administrative interfaces and system access
- Data in transit and at rest
- System infrastructure and containers

The security implementation must follow industry best practices, provide defense in depth, and comply with modern security standards while maintaining usability and performance.

## Decision
We will implement a **comprehensive security strategy** with HTTPS encryption via Let's Encrypt, security headers, access controls, and secure development practices.

### Security Architecture:
- **Transport Security**: HTTPS with Let's Encrypt certificates
- **Application Security**: Security headers, input validation, CORS
- **Authentication Security**: OAuth 2.0 with secure session management
- **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Container Security**: Secure container practices and isolation
- **Network Security**: Firewall rules and network segmentation
