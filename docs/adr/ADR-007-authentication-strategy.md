# ADR-007: Authentication Strategy (OAuth 2.0 with Google)

## Context
InfraVault Phase 1 requires a secure authentication system that provides:
- User registration and login functionality
- Secure session management
- Integration with popular identity providers
- Protection of user data and uploaded images
- Scalable authentication for future growth
- Minimal user friction for account creation
- Compliance with modern security standards

The authentication system must be reliable, secure, and provide a good user experience while keeping implementation complexity appropriate for an MVP.

## Decision
We will implement **OAuth 2.0 authentication with Google** as the primary authentication method, combined with **JWT tokens** for session management.

### Authentication Architecture:
- **Identity Provider**: Google OAuth 2.0
- **Session Management**: JWT tokens with refresh token rotation
- **Authorization**: Role-based access control (RBAC)
- **Token Storage**: HttpOnly cookies for security
- **Backend Integration**: Go OAuth 2.0 library with Google provider
